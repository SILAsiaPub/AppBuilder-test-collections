# AppBuilder-test-collections

Gather a collection of minimal SFMs to provide proving tests.

SAB supports collections. The idea here is to have a very minimal set of files that are there to test for one thing per collection.

Each collection should have a readme.md that outlines what is being tested. It should also contain only as many files as is needed. 
If you want to link to another collection then use teh World English Bible.

This is a work in progress and contributions are welcome.

Please see score sheet: [Score card](PassFailNotes.md)
